**Meta-commentary:**

* “Spat” reduces broader political conflict to interpersonal drama.
* “Calls out” frames the statement as confrontation, priming readers for conflict.
* Use of “proof” gives high weight to a yearbook, a weak evidentiary source.
* Focus on personal past shifts attention away from current policy or actions.

**News Time**
Human from past riot. Human with weapon on rooftop. Said: event was not protest, was attack. Said destruction was not organic. Said it looked like plan.

Event was old. Civic zone disturbance. Human businesses burned. Human says police stood down. Human says media chose angles. Human says some humans acted like trained group.

Human says later event, more recent, had same pattern. Similar energy. Said humans waited for camera. Then acted.

Human says narrative shifted. Said left-side humans used emotion. Said right-side humans now do same. Human says both sides cause fear. Fear useful. For rule creators. For votes.

Human now lives quiet. Says he watches. Says next wave will come. Says it feels like setup again.

**Meta-commentary:**

* “Rooftop Korean” functions as an emotionally charged symbol; frames individual as hero
* “Left-wing riots” is overt framing; discredits spontaneous civic unrest
* “Manufactured” implies conspiracy without evidence
* “Next George Floyd” reduces unique tragedy to pattern, minimizing individual human loss
* Article uses survivor narrative to validate political skepticism, invokes mistrust of media and institutions

**Meta-commentary:**
Phrases like “espionage,” “covert ties,” and “national security threat” were used in the source article. These carry high emotional weight, designed to evoke fear and urgency. The term "firebrand" was applied to the civic leader, signaling a polarizing or volatile figure. The use of unnamed sources reinforces uncertainty but intensifies suspicion.

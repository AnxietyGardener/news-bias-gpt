# NEWS Bias GPT Instructions

*“Read the story, not the spell.”*

> Most people think they can “just read around the bias.”  
> But that’s not how emotional flooding works.

When you consume a news article—especially one with emotionally charged or tribal language—your brain reacts automatically. It releases chemicals. It triggers old beliefs. It subtly shifts how you interpret what follows.

This is called **emotional flooding**.  
It bypasses your rational filters and wears down your ability to stay objective. Over time, it shapes your worldview in ways you didn’t consciously choose.

**NewsTime** exists to interrupt that process.

## What This Is

**NewsTime** is a minimalist, emotionally-detached way to analyze news articles. This project gives you a ready-to-use set of custom instructions for ChatGPT (GPT-4) that will strip a news story down to its essential data and framing.

The goal is simple:  
Help people *evaluate news without being manipulated by it.*

No more accidental indoctrination.  
No more doomscrolling-induced anxiety.  
Just a clear-eyed, almost alien perspective on the facts being presented—and how they’re being emotionally or politically framed.

## What It Does

When you paste a news article into this ChatGPT project:

- It summarizes the article in *neutral*, detached language (described as “an alien” voice).
- It identifies emotionally charged language and manipulative phrasing.
- It flags logical fallacies, narrative techniques, and other tactics used to shape perception.
- It replaces references to people, governments, or organizations with abstract, generic terms (e.g. “the leading power,” “a conflict region,” “a political figure”).

You end up with something you can read **without triggering your emotional defenses**, so you can assess the story more rationally.

## Why It Exists

The modern news cycle often relies on **emotional engagement** to drive clicks, shares, and loyalty. Whether it’s fear, outrage, pride, or tribalism, these emotional levers shape our perceptions and our beliefs—often without us realizing it.

This project is for people who want to:

- Build critical distance from emotionally manipulative media
- Train themselves to spot bias and narrative framing
- Consume news in a way that supports **rational, intentional thinking**

If that resonates with you, give it a try—and if you're feeling bold, use the output in your own videos, discussions, or projects. This isn’t about pushing a new ideology. It’s about stepping back from *all of them* to see more clearly.
